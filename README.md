## Hi there 👋
# I'm Yaya Sopegue Soro

My name is Yaya Sopegue Soro. I am a fullstack developer living in France in the city of Evry-Courcouronnes, with skills in data analysis and design. I am passionate about roller skating, reading, and solving problems with code.
My last professional experience was at Dassault Systèmes as a fullstack developer. I worked on the revamp of the 3DNotification Center, a notification management application for **3DEXPERIENCE** applications. A very enriching experience as I was able to learn a lot of new technologies (legacy and new) and work in a team in an agile and above all multicultural environment.
My passion for web development started with the discovery of the Vue.js JavaScript framework. Since then, I have deepened my knowledge in front-end and back-end development by working on various personal and professional projects. I enjoy creating high-performance and intuitive web applications that offer an excellent user experience and, above all, meet the needs for which they are designed.

I like to use Nuxt.js for my front-end projects because it offers a solid structure and advanced features that facilitate the development of modern web applications. For the back-end, I particularly appreciate Node.js with Express.js due to their flexibility and performance, and Spring Boot for more robust and enterprise-level applications that are easy to maintain. I also enjoy working with relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL to efficiently manage data. I am also a DevOps enthusiast, using tools like Docker for containerization and Git for version control. I also use platforms like Azure and Netlify for deploying and hosting my applications.

Whether you need a new application, a revamp of an existing application, or need to strengthen your development team, or even just to say hello, feel free to contact me. I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations.

How I work on a requirement, a specific feature, or a complete application (from scratch or not):
I analyze your needs / I conduct a study of existing solutions.
I formally specify your requirements or identify the shortcomings of other solutions that could be addressed by your solution.
I design your application / system / database using use cases, and I define the relationships between the actors of your system / application.
I develop your application according to the previous steps, including unit and integration tests.
I deploy your application with the provider of your choice (which can be yourself), then I ensure application maintenance, preventive maintenance, and evolutionary maintenance.
